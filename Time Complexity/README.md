## Time Complexity of Algorithms
Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.

The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the big O notation.
It's an asymptotic notation to represent the time complexity.

## Types of Notation
- Big Oh denotes "fewer than or the same as" <expression> iterations.
- Big Omega denotes "more than or the same as" <expression> iterations.
- Big Theta denotes "the same as" <expression> iterations.
- Little Oh denotes "fewer than" <expression> iterations.
- Little Omega denotes "more than" <expression> iterations.

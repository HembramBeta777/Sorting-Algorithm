## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
It builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. 
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Characteristics of Insertion Sort
- It is efficient for smaller data sets, but very inefficient for larger lists.
- Insertion Sort is adaptive, that means it reduces its total number of steps if a partially sorted array is provided as input, making it efficient.
- It is better than Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.
- Its space complexity is less. Like bubble Sort, insertion sort also requires a single additional memory space.
- It is a stable sorting technique, as it does not change the relative order of elements which are equal.
